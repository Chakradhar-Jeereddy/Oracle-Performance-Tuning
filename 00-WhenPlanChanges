When initial execution plans are changed?
    This usually happens if there is significan difference between the object statistics in data dictionary and its actual statistics.
    When optimizer executes the query it monitors the number of rows that are actually returned by each operation and compares it with 
    the optimizer estimate. If optimizer realizes that the current object statistics do not reflect the current status, 
	  it changes the initial execution plan and use an alternative one that is more efficient. Techinically there are few mechanisms that 
    make the optimizer change initial execution plans. These loose mechanisms are collectively called adaptive plan.
