#Performance tuning is a complicated topic

-- Developers rush to program
-- Long learning curve, amazingly we don't find a reference that covers all the required knowledge for SQL tuning, when we dive into the tuning, we always
   Learn something new.
   
-- It is linked to all IT technology stack
   Starting from client machines, connections, appliances, server hardware, storage and database
   Don’t be surprised if you know after tuning a slow application performance that the issue is with storage that needs firmware upgrade.
   
-- Impacted by all system development stages, neglecting at certain stages will lead to performance issues later in the production environment.
   Establishing communication between different teams becomes as hard as issue itself.
   
-- Sometimes requires low level knowledge to get it fixed. 

-- Some performance issues cases are hard to reproduce.
   That’s why learning PT tools is just a first step, experience it what makes the real difference.
   On the contrary when you lean PT means that you actually make yourself different, it means you’re joining top IT professional team and by leaning the PT, you’re doing a big jump into that direction.
