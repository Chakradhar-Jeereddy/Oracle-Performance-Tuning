Cartesian Join


Is used when one or more of the tables does not have any join conditions to any other tables in the statement
Every row from one data source is joined with every row from the other data source
Number of output rows = number of rows in the first data set x number of rows in the second data set
Practically, it is rarely used


Example: SELECT EMP_NO,ENAME,DNAME FROM EMP, DEPT; (Join condition is missing)
