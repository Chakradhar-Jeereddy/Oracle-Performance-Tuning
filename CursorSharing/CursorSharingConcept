Cursor sharing parameter -
alter system set cursor_sharing=EXACT/FORCE;
alter session set cursor_sharing=EXACT/FORCE;

Note - when force is used, it replaces the literals with system generated bind variables. The SQL is stored in v$sqlarea.
       but force value as side effects, it should be tested before applying in prod. Sometimes it doesn't generate the variables to replace
       literals.
select sum(salary) from emp where dept_no=:"sys_B_0"

When multiple client connect and issues SQL statments which are same.
Same - Character by charector, space between keywords, objects referenced and literals.
--In the obove case, all client sessions use same parent/child cursor (stored in shared SQL area of library cache) to excute the query.

Case 1 - All sessions issue same query 
         In this case all sessions use its own PGA, but same cursor and execution plan.
Case   - Each session issue different query
         In this case all sessions use its own PGA, and CPU to generate execution plans and cursors.(hard parsing).

Example  - 
select sum(salary) from hr.employees where dept_no=101;
- Each statement with different literals has its own cursor, more memory is consumed, shared pool latches and hard parses.

Example - 
select sum(salary) from hr.employees where dept_no=:v_dept_no;
 - The cursor is shared among the client sessions
 - Better resource utilization, scalable, less shared pool latches
 - May lead to suboptimal plans for some bind variable values
