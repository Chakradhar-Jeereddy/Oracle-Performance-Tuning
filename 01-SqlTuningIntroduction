Oracle performance tuning
-- How to make Oracle sql statements run more efficently?
-- Look for specific information, measurable and achieveable target and not generic.
-- We can't waste time and effort to achieve unrealistic target.
-- Not how to tune the database, instance memory and IO.

Note - An SQL performance issue should be one which is spesific, measurable interms of time and achievable.

If we care about achieving the functionality of application with a peace of code without taking care of writing the code by following best practices.
Performance measutement is very important in testing phase.
Ideally the application should be stress tested againts volumes of data and number of application users that are near to their numbers in production.
If this not done, they will phase performance issues when they go to production

Truning areas

SQL tuning
 - data access structure
 - influence optimizer
 - monitoring SQL
 - Writing efficent SQLs
 
Instance tuning
Memory componenets
I/O
background processes
space managment
OS

Perpose of SQL tuning
 - Reduce user response time (Decreasing the time between when a user submits a statement and when the reponse is received)
 - increase throughput - Reducing the resources needed to execute the process.
 
Proactive - top/down
Reactive -  bottom/up


SQL tuning workflow/methodology

1) Identify the suboptimal statements (causing performance issue)
   by reviewing the past execution history and their SQL statistics
   
2) Gather performance related stats to build an efficient execution plan. Make sure objects referenced by the statements has their statistics updated.
    (Optimizer stats, histograms )
   
3) Determine the root cause of the problem
   Inefficently written SQL, suboptimal execs plans, Missing SQL access str, stale stats - h/waste

4) Define the scope of the problem 
   The scope of the solution should match the scope of the problem.
   Ex
   --A statement is using literals, need to enable cursor sharing (but it effects the whole database)
   -- Instread enable cursor sharing at session level or use baselines
   -- Optimizer behaviour, doing it as parameter level will effect the other modules inside database, instead do it at session or statement level.

5) Implement corrective action - Depends on the problem
   Rewriting the code
   


6) Prevent SQL performance regressions
  -- Update stats
  -- SQL profiles
  -- SQL plan baselines
