select object_name,subobject_name,value from v$segment_statistics where owner='ADAM' and statistics_name='buffer busy waits' and object_name ='I';

Note - The cause for buffer busy waits of index is becuase two many concurrent sessions trying to read leaf blocks into buffers. To reduce the contention
create hash partition index.
drop index i;
create index i on(id) global partition by hash(id) partitions 32;
