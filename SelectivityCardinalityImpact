What are we trying to achieve?

-- Describe the meaning and impact of selectivity, cardinality and system cost.

Selectivity:

-- It represents a fraction retrived rows compare to the total rows:
   It takes values from zero to one
   0: no row is selected from row set
   1: All the rows are selected
   
-- If one employee is selected from 100 employees from emp table the selectivity is 0.01. 1/100.

Note : Selectivity is internally calculated by optimizer, it will not be displayed with the tools that display the execution plan.
       If the query references multiple tables, there will be a selectivity value for each table in the query.

Cardinality:

-- Represents the number of rows returned by each operation in an execution plan.
   If 7 employees working in department 10, the cardinality of the select operation is 7.
   Cardinality is displayed in execution plan under Rows column.
   
   
-- How optimizer used selectivity and cardinality?
   For low selectivity operation, accessing the index is more efficient
   For high selectivity operation, accessing the table is more efficent. (Reading large portion of index followed by required portion by table)
   If stats are not updated or not available, it leads to misestimation of cardinality which lead to suboptimal plan.
   
   
Note - Selectivity is a relative number(faction) and cardinality is an obsolete number(no faction).
