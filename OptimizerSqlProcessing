-- Describe the Query Optimizer SQL Processing stages

-- What is the aim of query optimizer?
   Generate and select most optimal execution plan (plan with lowest execution cost).
   
-- What is cost?
   It is based on three factors.
   Selectivity (Stats based, gets from data dictionary) 
   Cardinality (Stats based)
   Cost: CPU, I/O and communication (fixed for a system).
   
   Theory - When a user submits a query to database, the database can execute the query in multiple possible ways. Those possible ways are called execution plans.
            Database has to decide amoung those execution plans which one is more efficient.
            The database part that generates possible execution plans and decides the best one among those is called query optimizer.
            Optimizer job is very crutial in any database performance, if it picks up a wrong execution plan, it may lead to a very suboptimal query.

-- How optimizer performance optimzation?

   Stage1: Parsing
           -- Syntax check
	       -- Semantic check (objects referenced by the query are exists.)
	       -- Shared pool check (See if the statement ever been executed before), if it is first time, optimizer generates hash value for the statement and 
	          saves it in the sharedpool.
	 
	  
   Stage2: Optimzation
           -- Generates possible exection plans (expensive state, database requires lot of resources to perform it). When ever it is possible we need to
		      avoide such steps, if a query references multiple objects, the optimizer can easly generate dozens of plans, thats why the step is considered and
			  expensive step.
			  
		   -- At the end of this stage, the optimizer should select most efficient plan and save it in the sharedpool along side sql statement and pass it to the 
		      next step.
			  
		    
   Stage3: Row source generation 
		   -- Genrate query plan, which means it receives execution plan from previus step and converts that into binary iterative plan. Combining the execution
			  plan produced in the previous steps into a language that is understood by the engine. (This is also an expensive process),
			  
	
	Stege4: Execution
	        -- Executes the row source tree produced by the row source generator.
