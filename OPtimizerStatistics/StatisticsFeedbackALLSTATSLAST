     - dynamic statistics used: dynamic sampling(level=2) : level 2 (at least one table has no statistics)

1 Examining how statistics feedback work
If object statitics do not reflect the actual cardinality.
During execution of query, the optimizer processes existing stats and generates a plan.
The statistics collector compares the execution plan with actual cordinality, if there is mismatch, it still use the plan and marks it as
is_reoptimizable=y. So next time it collects statistics on the fly, doesn't rely on object statistics and creates new plan 
in new cursor and marks it as is_reoptimizable=n, in theory the new plan should perform better.

You can know statistics feedback has been used in an execution plan when you see the following note:
- statistics feedback used for this statement.

--how to display cardinality estimate and actual cardinality in the plan.
--Use the gather_plan_statistics hint in the query:
select /*+ gather_plan_statistics */...from ...
Or set the statistics_level to ALL at session level
alter session set statistics_level='ALL';

when displaying the execution plan using display_cursor, use the 'ALLSTATS LAST' option in the format parameter

---SELECT * FROM table (DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_CURSOR(NULL, NULL, 'ALLSTATS LAST'));
------------------------------------------------------------------
| Id | Operation        | Name      | Starts | E-Rows | A-Rows
------------------------------------------------------------------
| 0 | SELECT STATEMENT  |           | 1      |        | 3256
|* 1 | TABLE ACCESS FULL| CUSTOMERS | 1      | 1      | 3256
------------------------------------------------------------------
--The estimated rows/cardinality is far from actual rows/cardinality, due to this mismatch a new plan gets generated during next execution of 
query.
Note - Differnce between dynamic statistics and statistics feedback-

---Advantage - 
   Automatically improves plans for repeated queries that have cardinality misestimates
--- Its mechanism:
      In the first execution of a SQL statement, the optimizer produces an
      execution plan based on the object statistics.
      At the end of the first execution, the optimizer compares between its
      cardinality estimates with the actual cardinality of each plan operation
      If the cardinality discrepancy is significant, then the optimizer stores its
      collected cardinality statistics for subsequent use and sets the
      IS_REOPTIMIZABLE to ‘Y’
      In the next statement execution, a new plan is produced using the collected cardinality

2) Examine how Dynamic statistics work - When stats are missing or insufficent statistics. The optimizer detects this at compilation time, where has statistics feedback
is during execution time. 

When statistics are missing the optimizer runs recursive query to get sample data and performs stats on it and creates an execution plan based on those
statistics. When we display the plan it will show in note.
Note- dynamic statistics used: dynamic sampling(level=2)

It will be showed in statement level too:
select /*+ DYNAMIC_sampling(s, 4) */...* from customer
