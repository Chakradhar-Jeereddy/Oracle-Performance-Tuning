###Statistics are grouped into 4 types.

The optimizer relies on the statistics to decide on the optimal execution plan.
If the statistics are unavailable,insufficent or not representitive suboptimal execution plan may be picked.

Clustering factor 
Is how the index rows are well-ordered in comparision to the order of the table rows.
examples
Customer_ID generated by sequence, the rows in the index as well as the rows in the table are well-ordered by this column. The clustering factor is low.
Customer_name are ordered in the index, but in randomly scattered along the table. The clustering factor is way high.

Cost of retrieving a row bases on an index = selectivity * clustering factor.
If we rearrange a table to reduce clustering factor of an index, it might impact the clusting factor of other indexes.
We need to study the incluence of rearranging the table for all of its indexes.
